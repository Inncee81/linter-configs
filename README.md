Linter Configs!
===============

Linting your code is importantâ€”especially when you work on a team! This
repository contains configuration files for the linters we use.

The appropriate files should be copied into each project you start. That way,
even if the company's linting configurations change, the project won't
suddenly be awash in linter errors. It also means that everybody working on
the project will have the linting configurations.

We use linters that aren't tied to any specific IDE (so everybody can use the
same ones), but there are lots of great plugins for interfacing with them, like
[AtomLinter] and [SublimeLinter].
